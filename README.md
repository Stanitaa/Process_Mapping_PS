 here is the Simplified Process Map for Amazon problem-solving in the figure above,


**Visualize and document the key steps:**
* POPS monitoring for item drops.
* Rodeo usage for accurate references.
* QA procedures for quality checks.
* Item handling, including conditions 15, 11, and multis.

**Collect Process Data:** Gather relevant data, including:
* Processing times for each step.
* Dwell times to identify potential delays.
* Error rates during order fulfillment.

**Create the Timeline:** Develop a timeline that includes:
* PNYP checks 2 hours before CPT.
* Item drops 90 minutes before CPT.
* Deadline for item handling 23 minutes before CPT.

**Assess Your Map:**
* Review the value stream map for accuracy and completeness:
* Identify potential bottlenecks, e.g., in multis processing.
* Assess equipment issues and dependencies between processes.

**Determine Opportunities:** Analyze the map to identify improvement opportunities:
* Streamline processes for better efficiency.
* Reduce errors through improved QA procedures.
* Enhance overall order fulfillment to improve customer satisfaction.
* Prioritize improvements based on their impact on the order fulfillment process.
