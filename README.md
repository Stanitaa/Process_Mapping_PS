# Problem-solve-Process-mapping
A detailed fill-in of the adapted Value Stream Map for Amazon problem-solving

**Select the Value Chain to be Mapped:**
Choose the order fulfillment process within Amazon's operations for detailed analysis.

**Empower the Team:**
Form a cross-functional team comprising individuals from order processing, quality assurance, logistics, and IT support.

# Map the Processes:

**Visualize and document the key steps:**
* POPS monitoring for item drops.
* Rodeo usage for accurate references.
* QA procedures for quality checks.
* Item handling, including conditions 15, 11, and multis.

**Collect Process Data:** Gather relevant data, including:
* Processing times for each step.
* Dwell times to identify potential delays.
* Error rates during order fulfillment.

**Create the Timeline:** Develop a timeline that includes:
* PNYP checks 2 hours before CPT.
* Item drops 90 minutes before CPT.
* Deadline for item handling 23 minutes before CPT.

**Assess Your Map:**
* Review the value stream map for accuracy and completeness:
* Identify potential bottlenecks, e.g., in multis processing.
* Assess equipment issues and dependencies between processes.

**Determine Opportunities:** Analyze the map to identify improvement opportunities:
* Streamline processes for better efficiency.
* Reduce errors through improved QA procedures.
* Enhance overall order fulfillment to improve customer satisfaction.
* Prioritize improvements based on their impact on the order fulfillment process.
